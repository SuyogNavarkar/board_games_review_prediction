# board_games_review_prediction
A board games review predicition system in machine learning.

We are using data set of over 80,000 games and use that information to train a Linear Regression Model 
and a Random Force Regressor to make predictions based off the information.

Using this model we can predict the actual user review. This can be very useful for board game manufacturers to analyze what kind of games
people like. 

Data set has been downloaded from the follwoing location:
